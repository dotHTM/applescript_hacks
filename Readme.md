# AppleScript Hacks

## No Warranty

No warranty and no expectation that anything here is useful (or still compiles under the present AppleScript engine).

Don't ask me for support, these are purely for reference.

## Licence

As good as Public Domain. Generally these are so short that there's no good in trying to anything about them. As such, take them and use them as you wish.

## About

A collection of rough math and system scripts that demonstrate a concept or do some function.

Some scripts assume that the appropriate system preference allowances have already been set, since I was always running these for myself on my machines, I never really put much effort into sanitizing them for unknown environments. Frankly, that should be the environment's responsibilty...

Anyway, these are almost exclusively from the earliest days of my hobby coding. AppleScript is a particularly miserable language to use at the begining. The unexpected workarounds of using a parenthesis-wraped `get` statement when some properties refuse to come out nicely being a main offender.

Odds are, any command line shell script is a better environment to solve most filesystem or batch processing needs with exception to roboticly punching keys via System Events or batch processing iTunes, which the later is solved by not caring about meta data and tossing your personally curated tracks for an Apple Music subscription.

So AppleScript is best for proprietry database apps and robo-dialing tab-able OS forms.

Rant over.

## File format

I'd like to provide these as flat text files in the ".applescript" format, but laziness has left most in their default, compiled ".scpt" versions. If something gets corrupted, I'm sorry for your loss.
