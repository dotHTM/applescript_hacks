# Services

The included Automator services are provided as sample workflows that serve as a shell to their coresponding script file.

For whatever reason, Automator is a terrible application to develop AppleScript in, it being much better to just write your code in such a way that `osascript` can hand off paramters at command line.

You'll need to take services like these and point them at the locations for your scripts one by one.
